# Office UI Fabric for Vue.js

## Information

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional Vue.js implementation of the [Office UI Fabric components](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/components). It should behave just like the [Office Fabric for React](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) library, which is provided by Microsoft. The stylings are taken directly out of this library, to make sure no one feels or sees any difference.

This library is in early alpha stage. The list of supported components is pretty small right now, but it will expand constantly.

## Supported Components

- Checkbox

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project. Make sure to take a look at the [React implementation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) provided by Microsoft.
